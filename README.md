Incognide unifies chat, code, documents, web browsing, and media into a tileable workspace with intelligent context and composable automations.

Built for seamless workflows, Incognide eliminates distractions and context switching. A path-based organization keeps your work structured naturally, while auto-saving workspaces let you resume any project exactly where you left off. No more juggling desktops, drowning in browser tabs, or hunting for scattered files.


### Highlights

- Write and run code, use terminals, build reusable workflows and tools that chain together natural language and templateable code through jinja execution templates.
- Browse the web, read and annotate PDFs, view 3D STL models, analyze data and create dashboards, compile LaTeX.
- Edit DOCX, XLSX, PPTX.
- Arrange chats, editors, PDFs, browsers, terminals, 3D viewers as your work evolves — each tab maintains independent state.
- Manage agents, have them run on scheduled jobs, edit team context, integrate with MCP Servers, approve or reject suggested memories, prune and evolve knowledge graphs.
- Schedule automated memory extraction, knowledge graph evolution, and context compression.
- Fine-tune text models using curated data from your conversations and memories.
- Built-in Pomodoro timer with programmable schedules and break enforcement.

## Setup

### 1. Install

Download the installer for your platform from [enpisi.com/incognide](https://enpisi.com/incognide), run it, and launch Incognide. Linux, macOS, and Windows are supported.

### 2. First launch — setup wizard

On first launch the wizard walks you through five steps:

1. **Welcome** — intro screen.
2. **Preferences** — theme (dark/light) and the data directory for teams, models, and configs (default `~/.incognide`).
3. **Defaults** — default web search engine, default terminal shell (auto-detected per platform: `system`/`zsh`/`bash` on mac/linux, `powershell` on Windows), and activity tracking opt-in (local only, used for next-action predictions).
4. **Usage path** — pick one of:
   - **No AI** — workspace only (files, code, browsers, terminals, docs, maps). No model calls.
   - **Cloud AI** — OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / etc. via API keys.
   - **Local AI** — Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp / oMLX running on your machine.
5. **Cloud keys** (cloud-ai path) or **Local models** (local-ai path). See step 3 below for details.

The wizard writes preferences to `localStorage` (theme, fonts, shortcuts, UI defaults) and settings to `~/.incogniderc` .

### 3. Connect a model provider

#### Local providers

The setup wizard (Local Models step) and the in-app Model Manager both probe these endpoints and binary locations:

| Provider    | Server port | Binary / app checks                                        |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ollama      | 11434       | `ollama` in PATH; `/Applications/Ollama.app` on macOS      |
| LM Studio   | 1234        | `lms` in PATH; `/Applications/LM Studio.app` on macOS      |
| llama.cpp   | 8080        | `llama-server`, `llama-cli`, or `koboldcpp` in PATH        |
| oMLX        | 8000        | `omlx` in PATH; `/Applications/oMLX.app` (macOS only)      |

Each tile shows one of three states: **Running** (server responds), **Installed (not running)** (binary or app found but port is dead), or **Not found**. The Model Manager has Start/Stop buttons when the binary is installed:

- Ollama: `open -a Ollama` (macOS) or `ollama serve` (Linux). Stop via `pkill -f 'ollama serve'` (or kill from the Windows system tray).
- LM Studio: `lms server start` / `lms server stop` if the `lms` CLI is present; otherwise the app launches and you start the server from the Developer tab.
- llama.cpp: requires a model path to start, so Incognide prints the exact command (`llama-server -m <model.gguf> --port 8080`) for you to run in a terminal. Stop via `pkill -f llama-server`.
- oMLX: `open -a oMLX` launches the menu-bar app; stop/start the server from its menu-bar icon.

GGUF / GGML model files can be loaded directly without a server, but only if **llama.cpp or koboldcpp is installed** — the Model Manager's GGUF tab depends on that engine and shows "Not found" otherwise.

#### Cloud providers

Add API keys on the **Cloud keys** step of the wizard, or later in **Settings → Global Settings** or **Team Management → API keys**. Keys are stored in `~/.incogniderc` as `export <PROVIDER>_API_KEY=...`.

#### OrcaRouter

[OrcaRouter](https://www.orcarouter.ai) is a first-class provider, so it appears in the provider list and the model selector like any other. It offers two independent ways to connect, both shown in the OrcaRouter card in **Model Manager**:

| Choice | How it works | Credential |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **OrcaRouter - API** | Paste an existing `sk-orca-…` key, or set `ORCAROUTER_API_KEY` in `~/.incogniderc`. | A key you already own. No network call is made to validate it; the first request settles it. |
| **OrcaRouter - Auth** | Click **Connect with OrcaRouter** — your browser opens the consent screen and the key comes back automatically (OAuth 2.0 + PKCE, S256, loopback redirect, no client secret). | A durable key issued to your own account. Reused until you revoke it; there is no refresh grant. |

Both paths produce the same durable API key, stored encrypted with Electron `safeStorage` in `$INCOGNIDE_HOME/orcarouter_credentials` (the same mechanism used for saved browser passwords). Revoke your access at any time from the [OrcaRouter console](https://www.orcarouter.ai/console/authorized-apps).

**Endpoints.** Inference and model discovery use `https://api.orcarouter.ai/v1` with the OpenAI wire format. Authentication uses a different origin, `https://www.orcarouter.ai`, at `/auth` and `/api/v1/auth/keys`. Self-hosted deployments can set `ORCA_BASE_URL` (shared origin, `/v1` is appended for inference) or the explicit `ORCA_AUTH_BASE_URL` / `ORCA_API_BASE_URL` overrides, which take precedence. Remote origins must be HTTPS; plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback.

**Models.** The model dropdown is populated from `GET /v1/models` with your own key, so it reflects what your workspace can actually call. Each AI input filters that catalog by capability: text chat keeps only models advertising a text endpoint, attaching an image narrows the list to models that declare image input, and embeddings, image generation, video and rerank use their own dedicated filters. A model that does not declare a required capability is never offered, and a selection that stops being compatible is cleared rather than kept. If discovery fails, a small verified fallback list is shown and labelled as degraded.

### 4. Local setup for fine-tuning

Inference with LLMs is routed through the bundled backend (including calls to locally running models with llama.cpp, omlx, etc), but users can also fine-tune models within incognide. To accomplish this, you need to specify a Python virtual environment with the heavy packages (`torch`+ `transformers` etc.). For such calls, Incognide shells out to the specified venv instead of including these dependencies in the bundled backend to keep the packaged executable small.

1. Open **Team Management** (Users icon in the right sidebar or the settings screen).
2. Go to the **Python Env** tab.
3. Choose an environment for the current workspace:
   - **Detected**: list of venvs/pyenv/conda/uv environments found under the workspace, homedir, and common paths.
   - **Create new venv**: creates `<workspace>/.venv` (or the name you pick) with the system Python.
   - **Custom path**: point at any existing Python interpreter.
4. With an environment selected, click **Install packages** and pick one of the bundles:
   - `PyTorch (CPU)` — `torch torchvision torchaudio`
   - `PyTorch (CUDA)` — same plus the CUDA index URL for GPU builds
   - `Diffusers (Image Gen)` — `diffusers transformers accelerate safetensors`
   - `Transformers (LLM)` — `transformers accelerate safetensors sentencepiece`
   - `Whisper (Speech)` — `openai-whisper`

   Or install any specific package by name.


### 5. Data directory

Incognide stores teams, NPCs, jinxes, memories, knowledge graphs, and model configs under the data directory you picked in step 2 (default `~/.incognide`). Changing it in **Settings → Global Settings → Default Directory** updates `~/.incogniderc`'s `INCOGNIDE_DATA_DIRECTORY`.

### 6. Troubleshooting

- **Backend unhealthy indicator in the status bar** — right-click the `npcpy` icon in the status bar for Restart / View Logs. Logs live in `~/Library/Logs/Incognide/` (macOS), `~/.config/Incognide/logs/` (Linux), or `%APPDATA%\Incognide\logs\` (Windows).
- **Tutorial didn't highlight anything** — the tutorial opens the Help pane before it starts so the workspace highlight has a target. If it runs before any pane is open you'll see an un-highlighted step; re-run it from **Settings → Replay Tutorial**.
